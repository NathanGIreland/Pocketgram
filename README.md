# Pocketgram

Currently I have an repo with a project named parstsgram. The goal of this project was to learn how to build an iOS application with similar features of Instgram. The main down side of the project is that the code is poorty organized and hard to read. With this project Im planning to refactor project with a goal to improve its organization and implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. Alongside this refactoring, I am planning to learn new tools and extend functionality.

My primary motivation behind this project is to transform the existing project, which currently suffers from poor organization, into a more maintainable project. I'm also motivated to learn new tools and sharpen my skills in both the Front-end and backend as an iOS Developer

### Tools and Technologies

To build a comprehensive Instagram clone app, I plan to leverage the following tools and technologies:

1. **Front-end Frameworks**: Utilizing UIKit to build a dynamic and responsive user interface for the Instagram clone app.

2. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Integrating user authentication and authorization features using Firebase Authentication for secure access and protection of user data.

3. **Database Management**: Utilizing Cloud Firestore as a reliable backend solution for storing and retrieving user-generated content.

4. **Cloud Storage**: Leveraging Firebase Cloud Storage to efficiently store and manage user-uploaded photos and videos.

5. **Push Notifications**: Exploring push notification services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to provide users with real-time updates and engagement.

<!-- 6. **Image Processing**: Implementing image processing functionalities such as resizing, cropping, and applying filters using libraries like Sharp, GraphicsMagick, or ImageMagick. -->
