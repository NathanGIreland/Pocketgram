# Pocketgram

Currently, I have a repository with a project named "Parstsgram." The goal of that project was to learn how to build an iOS application with similar features to Instagram. However, the code in its current state is poorly organized and difficult to read. In this new project, my plan is to refactor it, focusing on improving its organization and implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. Additionally, I aim to expand its functionality and learn new tools along the way.

The main motivation behind this project is to transform the existing codebase into a more maintainable and structured project. As an iOS Developer, I am also eager to enhance my skills and knowledge in both frontend and backend development.

### Tools and Technologies

To create a comprehensive Instagram clone app, I intend to leverage the following tools and technologies:

1. **Front-end Frameworks**: Utilizing UIKit to build a dynamic and responsive user interface for the Instagram clone app.
2. **User Authentication and Authorization**: Integrating user authentication and authorization features using Firebase Authentication for secure access and protection of user data.
3. **Database Management**: Utilizing Cloud Firestore as a reliable backend solution for storing and retrieving user-generated content.
4. **Cloud Storage**: Leveraging Firebase Cloud Storage to efficiently store and manage user-uploaded photos and videos.
5. **Push Notifications**: Exploring push notification services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to provide users with real-time updates and engagement.

<!-- 6. **Image Processing**: Implementing image processing functionalities such as resizing, cropping, and applying filters using libraries like Sharp, GraphicsMagick, or ImageMagick. -->
